# Space Jumper - Windows Forms 2D Game

A fast-paced, physics-based survival game developed using C# and the .NET Framework. This project demonstrates core game loop logic, real-time input handling, and object-oriented programming principles.

## How to Play
* **Spacebar**: Fly Up (Jetpack) - Release to fall via gravity.
* **Enter / R**: Start or Restart Game.
* **Esc / P**: Pause and Resume logic.
* **Backspace**: Safely exit the application.

## Technical Setup
* **Framework:** .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
* **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio
* **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
* **C# Programming:** Implementation of event-driven logic and control flow.
* **Game Physics:** Custom gravity acceleration, velocity handling, and terminal velocity logic.
* **Memory Management:** Efficient handling of object arrays to manage multiple on-screen obstacles.
* **Collision Detection:** Real-time boundary and intersection checking between game entities.
* **UI/UX Design:** User interface state management (Start, Pause, Game Over) and keyboard-driven navigation.
